# A cloud platform to assess urban ecosystem services

Nature-based contributions to urban design are central to climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction. The urban green infrastructure provides notable benefits to the rapidly growing urban populations. Examples of such benefits - often referred to as urban ecosystem services- include the alleviation of urban heat islands, flood risk mitigation or the provision of recreational opportunities.

We propose a cloud-based platform to model urban ecosystem services to support the spatial planning nature-based solutions for:

* **GIS engineers**: set up simulations of the provision of ecosystem services in master plans, future urbanization scenarios and to assess the impact of specific interventions
* **Planners and decision-makers**: visualize and analyze the results to support urban planning, compare alternative scenarios and spatially prioritize interventions

## An example case: mapping potential urban heat mitigation

![Potential urban heat mitigation. The left plot shows the existing tree canopy (in green), whereas the blue pixels highlight candidate locations where new trees could be added (sidewalks, parking lots and other non-built impervious surfaces). The right plot shows the heat mitigation by adding trees to 50% of the candidate locations (blue pixels in the left plot).](reports/figures/figure.png)

## Features

The platform builds on the start-of-the-art tools for data science and scientific computing to provide an efficient cloud-based, interactive experimentation with cutting edge models of ecosystem services in Swiss urban areas:

* **Data curation** of datasets from administrative sources in Switzerland (SWISSTOPO, Swiss Federal Statistics Geodata, MeteoSwiss, ASIT, SITG...)
* A **user-friendly interface** to cutting-edge models of urban ecosystem services (urban heat island mitigation, flood risk mitigation, recreation opportunities, carbon sequestration...)
* **Interactive visualizations** of the spatial provision of ecosystem services with multiple layers and side-by-side comparison of alternative scenarios.
